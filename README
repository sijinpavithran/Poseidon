This is a simple application which uses spring multi action controller.

This is a software for laptop service center management

Programs needed to download / set up
------------------------------------
1)    JDK 1.5 or higher(1.7 is preferred)
2)    MySQL Community server (Database), MySql workbench latest versions
3)    JBoss 4.2.2 GA (higher versions can be used, if the configurations are updated correctly)
4)    Intellij IDEA 11.1 Community Edition (Eclipse can also be used, I don't prefer Netbeans)
5)    Git (with out this also it will work fine, as Intellij & Eclipse support checkout from the IDE itself)

Steps for testing the Application
---------------------------------
1)    Install all the above
2)    Download the war file from the dist directory
3)    create a user localuser in mysql (with password as localuser)
4)    restore the db file from the code ( a file named databaseScripts.sql is available at WebContent/WEB_INF/databaseDesign folder)
5)    assign desired permission to the localuser for the new schema
6)    Put the war file in jboss/server/default/deploy directory
7)    Start the JBoss server from jboss/run.bat , In http://localhost:8080/Poseidon/ our application will be up and running.
8)    Either create a database user name as username and password as password, or edit the same in Poseidon/WebContent/WEB-INF/applicationCotext.xml
9)    In Mysql work bench insert a restore script which is available in Poseidon/WebContent/WEB-INF/databaseDesign/databaseScripts.sql

Now everything will work as expected.

Current Features
----------------
1) Uses spring multi action controller
2) Uses jquery

The changes we plan are:
------------------------
1)  Hibernate
2)  Add Unit test - junit 3
3)  Ability to read data from a property file
4)  Mock the db , and should be able to be live on mock mode
5)  Internationalization of pages (web pages, its partially done now)
6)  Jasper reports integration (in progress)
